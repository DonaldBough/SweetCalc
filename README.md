# SweetCalc
## Why
Being a diabetic can be frustrating enough when worrying about the hundreds of different factors that affect your blood sugar. By using factors advised by a medical professional, Sweet Calc can help figure insulin dosages for diabetics.

Of course, with some having special factors others might not have, be sure to double check the dosages to be sure you are getting the right amount of recommended insulin.

## Background
This was a fun side project during my beginning days of working with Android.
